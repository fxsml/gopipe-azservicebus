# Review PR

Review PR `$ARGUMENTS` (or the current branch PR if no number given) against project standards.

## Steps

1. Fetch PR details:
   ```bash
   gh pr view $ARGUMENTS
   gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS
   gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS
   ```

2. Review against each checklist item below and report pass/fail with specific line references

## Review Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Errors returned, not panicked (except `Must*` functions)
- [ ] Errors wrapped with context: `fmt.Errorf("op: %w", err)`
- [ ] `context.Context` passed as first argument, respected for cancellation
- [ ] Azure SDK receiver/sender closed properly (defer or explicit close)
- [ ] Message lock renewal handled for long-running processing
- [ ] No goroutine leaks — goroutines tied to context or explicit stop signal

### Tests
- [ ] Table-driven tests for multiple cases
- [ ] Both success and error paths tested
- [ ] `t.Parallel()` used where safe
- [ ] New public APIs have tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs have godoc (first sentence starts with function name)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API without discussion

### Git
- [ ] Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- [ ] No merge commits in feature branch history
- [ ] PR targets `develop`, not `main`

## Reference Procedures

- @../docs/procedures/coding.md — simplicity, surgical changes, scope discipline

```
